## Description

## User Story
```
As a marketing agency,
I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards
So that oue site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Updates Made & Mock-Up
Semantic tags added (header, nav, section, article, side, footer)
Added alt text for images
Consolidated redundant CSS styling

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
